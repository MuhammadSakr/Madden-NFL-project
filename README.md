# Madden-NFL-project
- Madden NFL is an American football video game series developed by EA Tiburon for EA Sports.

- The client asked not to share the data .. he agreed just to share visualizations.

- He wanted to see some comparisons using equations he provided.

- The comparisons was like "Every player VS Every team" for every position one by one.

- He wanted to use these comparisons to see the best players for every match in the future to use them in bets.

- This was for the excel sheet (which cannot be shared).

- Then he asked to compare the teams using average points for every position, and this is what the visualizations show.
